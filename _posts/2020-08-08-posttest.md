I had the opportunity of contributing to a collection of notable  judgments pronounced by Indian courts and tribunals, between May 2018 and June 2020. The  compendium looks at several key areas of law, and contains summaries of these judgments. It has been published as a knowledge sharing exercise by SNG & Partners, and a copy is accessible  on their website, at the following link: [**SNG & Partners - Notable Judgments (2018-2020)**](https://www.sngpartners.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Notable_Judgements.pdf). 

More specifically, I contributed to the sections on the [**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code**](https://www.sngpartners.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Notable_Judgements.pdf), as well as  [**general labour laws**](https://www.sngpartners.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Notable_Judgements.pdf).
